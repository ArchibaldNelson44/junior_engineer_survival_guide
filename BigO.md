### What is Big O:
* It's our way of talking about how long it takes for an algorithm to run, or how _quickly runtime grows_.
* In Big O __runtime__ is expressed in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the input.
* The size of the input is described as _n_. Runtime grows _on the order of the size of_ n.
